## Challenge - React Suspense

Implement a component that displays a list of users fetched from an API. The component should display a loading spinner while the data is being fetched, and an error message if there is an error.

Use the **`fetch`** function to retrieve the data from the following API endpoint: **`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`**.

## Requirements:

- The component should use React Suspense to manage the loading state and display the spinner.
- The component should handle errors using a try-catch block.
- The component should display the list of users in a table, with each row showing the user's name and email address.
