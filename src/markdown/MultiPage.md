# Instructions

## Challenges

- Use React and React Router to build a single page application (SPA) with multiple routes

- Use a CSS preprocessor (such as Sass or Less) to style the application

- Use a state management library (such as Redux or MobX) to manage the application's state

- Use an HTTP client (such as Axios or Fetch) to make HTTP requests to a server

- Use a form library (such as Formik or React Final Form) to handle form submission and validation

- Use a testing library (such as Jest or Enzyme) to write unit tests for the application
